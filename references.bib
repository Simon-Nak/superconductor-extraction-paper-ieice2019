But due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such molecules, this task is highly complex and should be supported by computational tools.Results: We present ChemSpot, a named entity recognition (NER) tool for identifying mentions of chemicals in natural language texts, including trivial names, drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry entities. Since the different classes of relevant entities have rather different naming characteristics, ChemSpot uses a hybrid approach combining a Conditional Random Field with a dictionary. It achieves an F1 measure of 68.1\\% on the SCAI corpus, outperforming the only other freely available chemical NER tool, OSCAR4, by 10.8 percentage points.Availability: ChemSpot is freely available at: http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/wbi/resourcesContact:leser@informatik.hu-berlin.de}",

The statistical model gives reasonable out-of-sample predictions: ±9.5 K based on root-mean-squared-error. Features extracted based on thermal conductivity, atomic radius, valence, electron affinity, and atomic mass contribute the most to the model’s predictive accuracy. It is crucial to note that our model does not predict whether a material is a superconductor or not; it only gives predictions for superconductors."
